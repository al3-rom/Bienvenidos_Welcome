Hello everyone!
I'm Alejandro, I'm 19 years old and I'm in a ConquerBlocks course to learn how to develop web pages with Python, HTML, and CSS. 
But there's one more thing! I won't only learn web development, i will also become a blockchain developer.
Here, I am going to outline my learning steps in Python and so on.
